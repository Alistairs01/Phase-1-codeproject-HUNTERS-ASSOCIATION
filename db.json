        "description" : "Kasaka's Venom Fang is a small black dagger with a white edge and a hilt made out of bones. On top of being able to grant its user an attack power boost of +25, the dagger also has two extra effects due to the fact that Kasaka's venom still remains inside it; Paralyze, which prevents a target from moving at a certain rate, and Bleed, which causes a target to lose 1% of their health for every second this effect is active and can potentially kill the said target from excessive blood loss."
